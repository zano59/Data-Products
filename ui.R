#
# The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of averages is often normal,
# even if the distribution that the data is being sampled from is very non-normal.
# We will run a variable number of simulations of an exponential distribution and
# will also show that this distribution is approximately normal if the number of 
# simulation is sufficiently large.
